Project Reflection
Project Summary:
This project focused on solving a simple banking system using C++. It was designed to demonstrate fundamental programming skills including file handling, object-oriented programming, and user input validation. The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly program that followed industry standards for code structure and documentation.

What I Did Well:
I believe I did particularly well with organizing the code into logical sections, commenting clearly, and following a clean, consistent style. My use of object-oriented principles made the code easier to understand and expand if needed.

Where I Could Enhance My Code:
If I were to improve this project, I would focus more on error handling and edge case testing. Adding stronger validation and exception handling would make the program more secure and less likely to fail under unusual conditions.

Most Challenging Part:
The most challenging part was managing file input/output and ensuring data consistency between program sessions. I overcame this by researching file stream operations in C++ and testing thoroughly. I'm also building my support network by using resources like Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, and official C++ documentation.

Transferable Skills:
The object-oriented programming skills, attention to documentation, and structured problem-solving approach from this project will be very transferable to other coursework and real-world software development.

How I Made It Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable:
I made the program maintainable and adaptable by breaking functionality into small, manageable functions and using descriptive variable names. The clear comments throughout the code explain the purpose of each section, making it easier for future developers (or myself) to update or expand the program later.
